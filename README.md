Considerations
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This application was developed specifically for Android, not for iOS or any other OS.

At the time this app was developed, the knowledge in Flutter and Dart was pretty basic making it a little monolithic and not so modularized as wanted.

The intented or goal users of this application are banana plantations producers of Costa Rica, with limited or absent support of any big companies (which does not exclude them from use it too). 
Because of this reason the selected language for user interaction is Spanish and the map displayed shows Costa Rica's country only, however in the future it could be extended to additional locations.
